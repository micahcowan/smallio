TODO

x Make a world, whose circumference is specified as a number of fixed-size blocks
x Camera with settable position
x Make a little guy who can run around it
x Make another little world, swap between them for whichever one you're closest to.
x Little jumper block that boosts your velocity.
- Rethink gameplay into something fun and arcady that I could conceivably wrap up soon.
.
- A smoother gravity effect? Maybe gather all the planet proximities,
  then weight constant gravity force directionally by proximities?
- Make blocks, warp them to fit world(?)
- Rotate camera around to follow little guy(?)
- Fix weird image-drawing logic? Maybe restore coordinate system to Javascript native :(
